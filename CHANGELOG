  the databases away.  Re-wrote fixperms to ensure ALL files in /var/lib/ldap/
  owned by ldap.

* Tue Nov 19 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.0.0-19

  pull more than the default number of entries. This caused the slave servers
  to only pull a subset of the proper entries. This has been fixed so that
  including syncprov will set the correct pull settings.

* Fri May 24 2013 Adam Yohrling <adam.yohrling@onyxpoint.com> 4.0-13
- Patched slapd.pp to use a dynamic ldap_sync_dn and ldap_bind_dn so that
  existing servers can optionally be used without reconfiguration.

- Removed pull_keys, as openssh now uses openssh-ldap to authenticate public keys.

- Added the variable $enable_logging to slapd::conf so that local4 can be
  captured.
- Changed puppet://$puppet_server/ to puppet:///
- The pull_keys define now simply takes all of the values that akeys requires
  instead of pulling them from /etc/ldap.conf. This is because SSSD does not
  populate /etc/ldap.conf.

  script.

  will only accept password changes on passwords that it can read. This
  requires the 'exop' change above.
- pwdGraceAuthNL is now set to 0 in default.ldif. We do not want to allow
  "grace" logins after lockout.
- Stop slapd from purging /etc/openldap
- Updated to use rsync native type

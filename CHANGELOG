- Per CVE-2014-3566, SSLv3 and TLSv1 ciphers should be disallowed. Recent-ish
  updates to openldap-servers, shipped with SIMP-6.0.0-0, includes a parameter
  to specify a minimum bound of TLS protocol in slapd.conf, TLSProtocolMin.
  (see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1234843)

* Thu Jul 30 2015 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.1.1-2

  plugin.
- This means that you *must* have version simp-ppolicy-check-password-2.4.39-0
  or later available to the system being configured.

- Spec tests were missing Facts used by supporting modules, due to
  updates over time. Spec tests now run cleanly.

  * ldap::master
- Updated to use the pki::copy define.
- Removed the openldap::slapd::pki class
- Removed all reliance on Rsync and added the setting of schemas to
  openldap::server. Made the schema source variable so that you can add your

  need to be removed before bootstrap will run again.

  the databases away.  Re-wrote fixperms to ensure ALL files in /var/lib/ldap/
  owned by ldap.

* Tue Nov 19 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.0.0-19

* Wed Jul 10 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.0-14

  pull more than the default number of entries. This caused the slave servers
  to only pull a subset of the proper entries. This has been fixed so that
  including syncprov will set the correct pull settings.

* Fri May 24 2013 Adam Yohrling <adam.yohrling@onyxpoint.com> 4.0-13
- Patched slapd.pp to use a dynamic ldap_sync_dn and ldap_bind_dn so that
  existing servers can optionally be used without reconfiguration.

- Removed pull_keys, as openssh now uses openssh-ldap to authenticate public keys.

  openldap::slapd::access::add to add custom access control capabilities to
  /etc/openldap/slapd.access.

* Fri Apr 22 2011 Maintenance - 2.0.0-1
- Added the variable $enable_logging to slapd::conf so that local4 can be
  captured.
- Changed puppet://$puppet_server/ to puppet:///
- The pull_keys define now simply takes all of the values that akeys requires
  instead of pulling them from /etc/ldap.conf. This is because SSSD does not
  populate /etc/ldap.conf.

  script.

- Stop slapd from purging /etc/openldap
- Change default password mode in /etc/ldap.conf to exop to allow for server
  side password enforcement.
- PwdChangeQuality is now set to 2 in default.ldif. This means that the server
  will only accept password changes on passwords that it can read. This
  requires the 'exop' change above.
- pwdGraceAuthNL is now set to 0 in default.ldif. We do not want to allow
  "grace" logins after lockout.
- Stop slapd from purging /etc/openldap
- Updated to use rsync native type
- Updated to use concat_build and concat_fragment types

- Modified the configuration to use the last entry in ldapuri as the default
  LDAP master and a variable, ldap_master_uri for explicitly setting the value.
- Openldap slave no longer validates certs in support of GNOME.

* Mon Nov 02 2009 Maintenance
0.1-27
- Changed the permissions on /etc/ldap.conf to 644 by default so that the GUI
  applications would work better by default.
